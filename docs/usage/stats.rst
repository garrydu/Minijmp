- Stats Summary: Choose the column of data to get the stastical summary. 
- The default percentiles to calculate can be changed in the input box, the numbers are in percentage. For example, 100 is 100%. Separate the number with comma, while space is optional.

The sample output is:

The statstical items on the top table is locked by default, while the percentiles on the lower one depend on the input. Here are the explanation of the statstical items:

- N: The total number of valid inputed numbers.
- Mean: The average of all valid inputed numbers.
- StDev: The standard deviation of all valid inputs. The formula for standard deviation is :math:`\sigma = \sqrt{\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \mu)^2}{n}}`
- SE Mean:  Standard Error (SE) of the mean, which is SE = s / âˆšn.
- Variance: The Variance of the inputed numbers, which is square of standard deviation. The standard deviation is always the square root of the variance. The formula for variance is :math:`\sigma^2 = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \mu)^2}{n}` The relationship between standard deviation and variance is :math:`\sigma = \sqrt{\sigma^2}`
- CoefVar: The coefficient of variation (CV) is a statistical measure that represents the ratio of the standard deviation to the mean. The formula for coefficient of variation is :math:`CV = \left(\frac{\sigma}{\mu}\right) \times 100`
- Sum: The total sum of all valid inputed numbers.
- Min: The minimum of all valid inputed numbers.
- Q1: Q1, or the First Quartile, is a measure of statistical dispersion that indicates the value below which 25% of the data falls. It essentially marks the 25th percentile of a dataset.
- Median: The median is a measure of central tendency that represents the middle value in a dataset when it is arranged in ascending order. It effectively divides the dataset into two equal halves, with 50% of the data points lying below the median and 50% above.
- Q3: Q3, also known as the upper quartile, is the value that separates the highest 25% of data points from the lower 75% in an ordered dataset. It marks the 75th percentile of the data distribution.
- Max: the maximum of the all valid inputed numbers.
- Range: The difference between Max and Min.
- IQR: The Interquartile Range (IQR) is the difference between the third quartile (Q3) and the first quartile (Q1) of a dataset. It represents the middle 50% of the data.
- Mode: In statistics, the mode is the value that appears most frequently in a dataset. For example, in the set {2, 3, 3, 4, 5, 5, 5, 6}, the mode is 5.
- N for Mode: The number of times of the Mode appearing in the data set.
- Skewness: Skewness measures the extent to which a distribution deviates from symmetry around its mean. `WIKI LINK <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skewness>`_
- Kurtosis: Kurtosis is a statistical measure that describes the shape of a probability distribution, specifically focusing on the "tailedness" of the distribution. `WIKI LINK  <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurtosis>`_
- Percentiles: A percentile is a value below which a certain percentage of observations fall in a dataset. `WIKI LINK <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentile>`_

Describe MultiVar
-----------------

To calculate the same statistical summary upon multiple sets of data, i.e. multiple columns.

- In the Data column session, one or multiple column names can be selected. Using left click to toggle the selection, and also combining with CTRL and SHIFT.
- Toggle the selection of each statstical item that will be printed out in the output.
